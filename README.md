## Notice

This repository exists only to support some features that are not supported or denied
in [upstream](https://github.com/wong2/chat-gpt-google-extension), and for ethical reasons, I have not uploaded it to
any app store. It isn't related to any extensions of the same name that may exist in some app store

## Upstream supports, but not here

<details>
<summary>Details:</summary>

(I don't think these contents are very valuable, but I could be wrong, so if you think of some suitable application
scenario or related need, please create an issue)

1. Upstream supports setting the desired language, and will force the relevant words to be inserted at the end after you
   enter the question

    - but I think, users always expect to get the language corresponding to their question, when you want to get a
      different language, you should take the initiative to specify when searching, which is also consistent with the
      habits of using search engines, and this fork supports interactive mode, you can also continue to tell chatGPT
      what you want. Once you set up forced insertion, it will change the actual content of the user's question, for
      example, when you configure French and search in English, chatGPT will always reply to you in French, when you
      expect a reply in English, you will have to open the settings page, make changes, then refresh and ask the
      question again, which I think is a very bad process

2. The upstream extension popup window has an embedded chatGPT page (iframe)

    - but you have to open the chatGPT website and log in to use it, so I think, in that case, why not use it directly
      on the official website? In addition, interactive mode is already supported here, and each page can be used as a
      separate session, so this feature is less necessary
